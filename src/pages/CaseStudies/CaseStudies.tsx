          description="A curated list of backcountry locations &amp; their conditions. Built with React, SASS, MySQL, Node/Express. Google OAuth &amp; a traditional login flow for personalized choices. I also used Tan Stack's useQuery &amp; useMutate to facilitate data caching. The backend is deployed through Heroku and a JawsDB instance for the MySQL DB. The front end is deployed through Vercel with a custom domain."
          learned="This whole project was built group up and I tried to use as few frameworks as possible so that I could see how things were working under the hood. The one exception would be useQuery - I used this for data caching and state management and helped me use far fewer instances of useState than I normally would have."

          learned="Resourceful is a collaborative project shared between myself and 2 other developer friends. A good chunk of my time was spent in the back-end where we created an authorization middleware that I'm quite fond of. On the front end I was able to leverage this middleware in conjunction with react-router's new loader functionality to create awesome data persistance, as well as getting rid of the troublesome UI flashes that can happen when conditionally rendering elements."
